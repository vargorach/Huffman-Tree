# Huffman-Tree
This program inputs a user typed string that is then outputed as Huffman
code for each character and the total of bits used with the Huffman code and  
the original ASCII code. To use this program the user inputs a string and then 
presses enter when prompted to move on to the next step. The data expected is a 
string input and output of integers. The major algorithms are the making of the 
Huffman code and the sorting of the variables. The key variables are the string 
text that the user inputs and the roots of the nodes.
